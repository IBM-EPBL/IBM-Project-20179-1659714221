                <p>Phishing attacks are one of the most common form of social engineering attacks. In a web-based
                    phishing attack, attackers use web pages visually mimicking legitimate web sites, such as banking
                    and government services, to deceive the victims to input their sensitive information (e.g., bank
                    accounts and social security number). Though phishing attacks do not require advanced technical
                    knowledge and these attack techniques are becoming familiar to users, they are still causing major
                    financial damages.</p>

                <p>In several fields, automation has been achieved through the extensive use of machine learning. Our approach is based on the aggregate analysis method to automatically develop rules to determine layout similarity of web sites and then detect phishing pages. Researchers also utilise machine learning to detect phishing assaults based on numerous aspects. Our strategy is divided into two parts. It leverages the attributes of the website layout to first train a similarity classifier, which is then used to identify phishing pages..
